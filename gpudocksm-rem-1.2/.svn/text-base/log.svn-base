1. in size.h replaced the constants by MACRO
2. in gpudocksm.h declares the structs
3. _protein_seq1 and _protein_seq2 won't be used in energy calculation, so we set them as local variable in load.C, in order to save the struct space
4. data.h and data.C remained 
5.  in the complex.h
    int _pens_total;		//      total protein ensemble conformations
    int _pens_current;		//      current conformation
    int _pens_best;		//      best conformation
    deleted since now one replica contains only one conformation
6. # of protein residue is 104, correct
   # of protein effective points is 344, correct

7. protein finished, max_prt_conf is the return value for the max conformation number in the protein data file.

8. there are 138 lines in 1a07C1.sdf ligand data file, so why the max number of lib2 is 138?

9. _ligand_fpt_smiles and _ligand_fpt_macc appended.

10. _pocket_center declared in struct Ligand, since it is always acompanying the _ligand_cent. _pocket_center used to be the private member in class complex

11. double replaced by real in rmsd.f,double precision functions replaced by single precision functions in rmsd.f,  while double replaced by float in rmsd.h

12. float _lens_rmsd[MAXEN2] modified to float _lens_rmsd in struct Ligand

13. ligand complete 

14. PSP and MCS loading appended

15. loadParams started

16. size of the parameters 35.5 

17. InverseLig () only modify lig[0]. This should be fixed.
