* Preface
  decoy generation using gpu accelerated docking program
  
* Code development
  1. [X] energies does not need to be normalized
  2. [X] total energy equals the vdw plus the dst energy
  3. [X] ligand initialized at the native pose
  4. [X] calculate mcc along the monte carlo
      


* Simulation running
  1. single temperature
  2. no replica exchange

     
* Force field training
  1. /home/jaydy/Workspace/script/Pyscripts/gpu_decoy_class.py
  2. /home/jaydy/Workspace/script/Pyscripts/gpu_decoy.py
  
* Force field testing
  1. [ ] use test weight to combine the energies
  2. [ ] use test normalization parameters
  3. [ ]
