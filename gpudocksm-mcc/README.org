* Preface
  calculate mcc coefficient within the GPU docking framework

* develop log
** create the reference confusion matrix
   1) mcc coefficient can be treated as part of energy calculation
   2) confusion matrix resides on the shared memory ?
   3) reduce on a plain ?

** load the track file

** apply the move vector

** calculate the confusion matrix of the new cofiguration

** calculate mcc by comparing two confusion matrices
